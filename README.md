This is a p2p voice chat solution in the works.

Things needed in order to make complete are to fix the voice echoing back bug and a few other options.

In order to test:
  If hosting a chat session, port forward the port of choice to your computer's local ip address and then choose a Username,
  enter your chosen port number and leave the ip address blank. Click start and give your external ip address and port number to 
  invited users.
  
  If connecting to a call, choose a user name, enter in the ip address and port and click connect.
  
The jar file for this project is located in the dist folder and can be obtained by downloading a zip file of the project.
